Bach AI

A recurrent neural network that learns to replicate MIDI files. Currently not very user friendly.
Data is not included. Any MIDI files that only contain one tonal instrument should work. (Multiple instruments are probably too much for the network.)
Data folder can be set inside open_midi.py
